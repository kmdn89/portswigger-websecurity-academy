## Steps

### Analysis

First I try to use a productId that does not exist:

![productId_does_not_exist](img/productId_does_not_exist.png)

The application gently tells me that it did not find anything. So retry it again with some non-numeric value of the parameter:

The application does not handle this error gracefully and reveals the full exception including the vulnerable version of Apache Struts 2.

After submitting the solution, the lab updates to
