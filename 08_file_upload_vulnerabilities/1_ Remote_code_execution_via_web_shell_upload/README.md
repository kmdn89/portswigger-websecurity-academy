## Steps

### Analysis

The lab application is a blog website. On the public pages, nothing interesting appears obvious and I proceed to log in with the known user account of `wiener`. 

In the account settings, the user can set an email address as well as upload an avatar image:

![new_avatar](img/new_avatar.png)

### Find out what is allowed to upload

There might be a number of verification steps in place to check that the user-provided input is not malicious (ignoring the fact that the lab description says there are no validations). Common types of validations are:

- File extension
- Content-type
- Mime type
- Signature (magic numbers, usually the first few bytes of a file, e.g. png uses `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`)
- File parsing/rewriting

Most of these possible validations rely on information provided by the user. Therefore they can not be used reliably to validate the input. Unfortunately, this does not stop a lot of web applications to rely on them.

As a first step, I need to find out what is allowed to upload. So try a simple text file. The application confirms the upload:

![uploaded_text_file](img/uploaded_text_file.png)

The HTML code of the page shows the URL for the (now broken) image as `/files/avatars/file.txt`. Browsing to this file shows my text file. If there are any upload restrictions in place, they are very lax. 

In an ideal world, a web application should enforce a few things:

1. Ensure no code file gets uploaded by ideally enforcing a very strict and narrow set of rules.
2. Prevent any code that might slip through and end up in the avatar directory `/files/avatars/` from being executed.

### Upload a web shell

Considering this is an apprentice-level lab, I try to upload a simple PHP file that calls a single shell command:

```php
<?php echo shell_exec('id'); ?>
```

The response is fairly clear, I'm allowed to execute shell commands:

![RCE confirmed](img/id_executed.png)

So I send the original upload request into Burp Repeater and change the command to output the secret:

![Malicious payload uploaded](img/upload_file_output.png)

Calling the file will output the content of the secret file:

![Revealed secret](img/secret_data.png)

After submitting the information the lab updates to
