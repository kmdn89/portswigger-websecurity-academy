## Steps

### Analysis

The first step, as usual, is the analysis of the website, in this case, a webshop.

I can register a new account and see that employees of DontWannaCry should use their company email. As I do not have one I register a new account with my email address from the email client:

In my email client, I find the registration email with the confirmation link:

After confirming the email, I can log into my account.

### Change of email address

On the `my account` page, I noticed can update my email address. What happens if I simply change it to a `@dontwannacry.com` one? In theory, it should verify my ownership like during account registration. Let's find out:

After clicking on the `Update email` button, two things become obvious:

1. My email address is changed straight away
2. An `Admin panel` link appeared

This shows two things:

1. There is no validation on changing the email
2. The existence of an `@dontwannacry.com` email entry is the sole condition for access to the admin panel

So I go there to delete `carlos` and get a confirmation:
