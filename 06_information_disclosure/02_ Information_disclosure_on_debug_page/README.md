## Lab description

## Steps

The lab application is a shop website that is already well-known from other labs. Looking at the page does not reveal anything interesting.

Below, I show finding the target file using both the commercial Burp Professional as well as free tools outside of Burp.

### Using free tools

When I try to avoid using features from Burp Professional, several good free tools allow for content discovery. The one I use here is [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) together with the great wordlists provided by [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

First, I search for common directories within the web root of the application with 

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u https://0aeb000b03ce98ffc09d247e001c00a4.web-security-academy.net/FUZZ
```

I can now search within this directory for common files with 

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt  -u https://0aeb000b03ce98ffc09d247e001c00a4.web-security-academy.net/cgi-bin/FUZZ
```

### Using Burp Professional

With the Burp Content Discovery feature, it is just as easy to find the file.

I use the default options and start the discovery run. Burp quickly shows the `phpinfo.php` file in the site map:
