## Steps

### Analysis

As usual, the first step is to check out the website. It is the usual shop website used in numerous labs already. Logging in with the known credentials I see that I have 100$ in store credit, which puts the jacket slightly out of the possible range

So what happens when I put it in the cart? It lands there, but placing the order brings the reality check - it is too expensive:

So have a look at the requests done so far in Burp. The request to add it to the card looks rather promising, as it contains the price as a parameter.

Now, the looks much better already:

After placing the order, I still have a sizeable amount of store credit left:
